This file sums up my train of thoughts and what could/should be improved.

- Add the studenten A's
- track which elements are often done, to give more specific feedback.
- people give stars how difficult they find the element
- if onclick an element, a picture of the element needs to appear.

- Add 'inspiration' route
  Show example videos of routines (yt) and link to the routine from routine builder like so: ".com/routine_builder/?c=ab-cd-ef-01"

- add RANDOM to routine builder that puts random elements in it

- add "+"  button to elements table to add a specific element to the routine builder (page)
